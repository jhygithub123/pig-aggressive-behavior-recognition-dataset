# pig-aggressive-behavior-recognition-dataset
This project is used to open source the dataset of pig aggressive behavior recognition that we collected and produced.
Since our dataset is still in the confidentiality period of the project, we cannot open source the dataset for the time being. When the confidentiality period of the project ends, we will publish this dataset in early 2025.
